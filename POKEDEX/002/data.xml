  <ConceptOrigin>Anthureet's body type was inspired by various birds kept as pets, such as parakeets and cockatiels. The design is mixed with Anthurium, a common houseplant. The shiny variant of Anthureet represents a white Anthurium, while the regular represents a red cultivar. \nThe name is a fusion of words "Anthurium" and "parakeet".</ConceptOrigin>
