  <ConceptOrigin>Orchirp is based on small birds, mainly sparrows. There are elements of a pink Phalaenopsis orchid: petals as wings and hood, and a root as the tail. The lighter color variant is based on a Phalaenopsis orchid with white flowers. \nThe name is made of the words "orchid" and "chirp".</ConceptOrigin>
